# My favorite memory in MESA

My favorite memory in **MESA** is the bonding trip because I had a very **fun** day with all my friends, classmates, I met new places, and the ride to Pocono Valley was **fun**. The ride from and back to Brooklyn was fun since we took a *speaker* and were playing music. I had fun with my friends when we were kayaking in the lake and Camila would move the boat. All the food I had this day was really good and the ice cream at then end was good to cool down from being in the *sun* all day.
